## ðŸ’¡ What we do

Careswitch is building the worldâ€™s largest network of home care providers, caregivers, families, clients, and partners to create a more stable, coordinated home care experience for all.

We do this by building shared tools and common practices to create more consistency and transparency in the home care experience. Together, we leverage our collective scale to unlock more economic opportunity and improve quality of life for everyone in the home care community.
