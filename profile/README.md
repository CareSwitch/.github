[ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org) is a statically typed language based on OCaml that compiles to efficient JavaScript and integrates tightly with Reactâ€”here's a sample `Button` component:

```res
module Button = {
  type kind = Primary | Secondary

  @react.component
  let make = (~kind, ~children) => {
    let className = switch kind {
      | Primary => "p-4 bg-blue text-lg"
      | Secondary => "p-2 bg-gray-2 text-base"
    }
    <button className> children </button>
  }
}

<Button kind=Button.Secondary>
  {React.string("Press me")}
</Button>
```
